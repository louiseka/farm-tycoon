# Farm Tycoon

## Description

Iâ€™m currently building a Farm Tycoon game using TypeScript and React. The first version will include the following features:

- A dashboard, shop, farm, and a statistics tab.
- The ability to buy and sell animals and crops through the shop. 
- A daily balance paid to user.
- Purchased animals produce goods after a set number of days.
- Crops grow over time and are ready to harvest after a set number of days.
- A profit and expenses summary available in the statistics tab.
